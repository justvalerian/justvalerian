I'm an aspiring cartographer, currently enrolled in <a href="https://cartographymaster.eu/" target="_blank">an international M. Sc. programme</a>.
<br>Right now, I'm focusing methodically on responsive and interactive web visualizations as well as data visualization in general.
<br>Thematically my work centers around sustainability, organizational development and education.
<br>Feel free to contact me if you see a beneficial synergy with what you're doing at the moment.
