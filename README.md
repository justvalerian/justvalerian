I am a cartographer and coder.
<br>I enjoy working on interactive web maps, visualizations, and tools which utilize programming, storytelling, gamification, data science, and design to craft them.
<br>Since no one can work in a vacuum (except astronauts, perhaps), I am also interested in sustainability, organizational development, and education.
<br>Overall, I try to help make the world a better place by making knowledge more accessible and improving decision-making, one interface at a time. And in doing so, ensure the results are fun to use and the process enjoyable for all stakeholders.
