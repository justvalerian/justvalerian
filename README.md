I'm a cartographer, currently finishing the international <a href="https://cartographymaster.eu/" target="_blank">Cartography M.Sc.</a> with my thesis on MapColPal - a color palette generation and testing tool for thematic maps.
<br>Right now, I'm focusing methodically on responsive and interactive web visualizations as well as data visualization and programming in general.
<br>Thematically my work centers around sustainability, organizational development and education.
<br>Feel free to contact me if you see a beneficial synergy with what you're doing at the moment.
